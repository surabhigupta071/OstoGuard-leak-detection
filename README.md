# OstoGuard: Smart Leak Detection for Colostomy Care

## Overview
OstoGuard is an AI-powered system designed to detect potential leaks in colostomy and ileostomy bags before they occur, helping users maintain confidence and comfort.

This repository contains a simple prototype simulation of sensor data processing and leak prediction using a basic machine learning model.

## Features
- Simulated sensor data for pressure, moisture, and chemical levels
- A dummy leak detection model predicting leaks based on sensor input
- Basic code structure for further development

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the leak detection simulation:
python src/leak_detection.py
